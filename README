1. Intro
========================================

This perl module is encapsulation of the XSLT processor called
Sablotron. If you don't know, what is XSLT, look at
http://www.w3.org site. If you don't know, what is Sablotron, look
at http://www.gingerall.com.

Original creator of XML::Sablotron is Ginger Alliance s.r.o.; Czech
Republic.

XML::Sablotron is a simple Perl package, which encapsulates the C API
of Sablotron XSLT processor. The only important fact is, that this
package uses the dynamic linking of Sablotron.

If you need use this module on platforms, which do not allow dynamic
linking, please contact us.


2. Building
========================================

Here is what you need:
	a Linux box (tested on RH 6 and 7) with GNU C++ compiler
  or
	a NT box (testes on Win NT 4.0) with VC++ 4.2 (and later)

If you need any other port, please contact us.

You need also the Sablotron package to be correctly installed on you machine. 
If you don't have it, download it from http://www.gingerall.com.

Unpack the tar-ball file into a directory of your choice.

Change into the XML-Sablot* directory and type

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install (if you want; may require the root privileges)

Running a Win32 box you have to type:

  perl Makefile.PL LIBS="-Lx:\somewhere\lib"
  nmake
  nmake test
  nmake install (if you want)


If the test process fails, there may be something wrong with your 
environment. Please, check the following "Environment" section.

If you see any errors, you may try to fix it or just contact us.
Any help or feedback from users is highly appreciated.


3. Environment
========================================

NT boxes need set the PATH variable to the Sablotron bin/ directory.


4. Known problems
========================================

Due the mixing of C++ library (Sablotron) and C library (Perl
extension) there are some problems on several platforms (e.g
FreeBSD). This problems are caused by 'misunderstanding' between C++
and C linker.

As a result you may see complaints of unresolved symbols like
__rtti_user, __builtin_vec_new and/or others.

Solution is not simple and not deterministic. You have to force linker
to use some standard libraries (like -lgcc) while linking Perl
extension. To do it, set the LIBS='-lgcc' (or similar) as a
Makefile.PL parameter.

To pass required librraies to linker, you may use the LIBS parameter to Makefile.PL (e.g. perl Makefile.PL LIBS='-liconv -lreadline).
